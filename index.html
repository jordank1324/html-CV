    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> I am a recent graduate student having just finished my Masters of Science in Nanotechnology.
        I have quantitative, analytical, problem solving and computational skills which I have attained
        throughout my academic studies thus far. My work experience has helped me develop excellent
        communication and team-working skills.
